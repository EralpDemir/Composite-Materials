# Composite-Materials
Contains Matlab codes for design optimization of variable stiffness composites using lamination parameters within a finite element method framework.

"MAIN.m" is the main runner file.

Them-files with the prefixes contain the functions related to:
- "FEM_": finite elements
- "MAT_": material stiffness
- "LP_" : lamination parameter
- "LSC_": least-square and curvature constraints
- "OPT_": optimization

The userinputs are given in the m-file the suffix "_inputs". 
i.e. "FEM_inputs.m" contains the inputs related with FEM calculations.
